          <h1>Announcing Flatpak – Next Generation Linux Applications</h1>

          <p>
            Stockholm, Sweden – 21<sup>st</sup> June 2016 – The development team
            behind Flatpak is excited to announce the general availablity of their
            new framework for desktop applications on Linux. Previously named xdg-app,
            <a href="http://flatpak.org/getting.html"
              >Flatpak is available on a range of major Linux distributions</a
            >.
          </p>

          <h2>Build once, run anywhere</h2>

          <p><img alt="" src="/img/logo-press.svgz" class="fright" /></p>

          <p>
            The Linux desktop has long been held back by platform fragmentation.
            This has been a burden on developers, and creates a high barrier to
            entry for third party application developers. Flatpak aims to change
            all that. From the very start its primary goal has been to allow the
            same application to run across a myriad of Linux distributions and
            operating systems. In doing so, it greatly increases the number of
            users that application developers can easily reach.
          </p>

          <p>
            Speaking about the goals behind Flatpak, Alexander Larsson, its lead
            developer, said: “Application developers on Linux have always been
            prevented from having a direct relationship with their users. With
            Flatpak we're aiming to change that, so developers know exactly what
            their users are getting. With this launch we are making that goal a
            reality.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Flatpak has been available for a range of Linux distributions for
            several weeks. It allows application developers to build against a
            series of stable platforms (known as runtimes), as well as to bundle
            libraries directly within their applications. Flatpak is also
            standards compliant, offering support for the <a
              href="https://www.opencontainers.org/"
              >Open Container Initiative</a
            > specification.
          </p>

          <p>
            A growing range of applications are already available as Flatpaks,
            including LibreOffice, the GIMP, InkScape, MyPaint, Darktable, and a
            large number of stock GNOME applications. <a href="/apps.html"
              >flatpak.org provides instructions on how to easily try these
              yourself</a
            >. Linux desktops are also adopting Flatpak. A fully functional
            GNOME runtime has been available since March: this allows
            application developers to build and distribute Flatpaks using the
            GNOME development stack. Work on a similar runtime for KDE is
            proceeding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not only does Flatpak provide cross-distribution installation, but
            it also allows forward compatibility. Michael Meeks, Director of <a
              href="https://www.documentfoundation.org/"
              >The Document Foundation</a
            >, said: “Until now, building a LibreOffice that works for every
            Linux user has involved some horrible compromises caused by the need
            to build our binaries on an ancient Linux version to get good
            forward compatibility. Flatpak will enable us (as a Linux ISV) to
            distribute a better LibreOffice, with up-to-date dependencies and a
            platform that can run on many systems. I'm excited to see that
            happen.”
          </p>

          <h2>Security first</h2>

          <p>
            Another area where the Linux desktop has been weak is security: it
            has never had a viable model for isolating applications, or for
            gatekeeping access to user data. This is another area where Flatpak
            aims to upset the status quo. To this end, it has been built from
            the ground up with security in mind.
          </p>

          <p>
            Flatpak apps are sandboxed. From within the sandbox, the only things
            the app can “see” are itself and a limited set of libraries and
            operating system interfaces. This effectively isolates apps from
            each other as well as from the host system and makes it much harder
            for applications to steal user data or exploit one another.
          </p>

          <p>
            Initial Flatpak releases have concentrated on application building,
            distribution and installation, and while the foundations of
            sandboxing are in place, there are still missing pieces. “The next
            major Flatpak release will be all about sandboxing”, says Larsson.
            “Application authors will see a much more complete set of interfaces
            for interacting with the operating system from within a sandbox.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Another major part of this work is the widescale move towards the
            Wayland display server on Linux. X11 is inherently insecure, which
            makes it impossible to sandbox applications that are using it. In
            that sense, the growing maturity of Wayland complements Flatpak's
            emergence, and paves the way for much more complete security model
            for Linux distributions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Flatpak is the brainchild of Alexander Larsson, Principal Software
            Engineer at Red Hat. Larsson has been working in the Linux desktop
            space for 18 years. He was the principal author of GVfs (GNOME's
            Virtual Filesystem) and has done critical work on Docker, the SPICE
            protocol, the Gecko rendering engine, GLib and GTK+. He has
            considerable experience in the area of application bundling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Flatpak builds on several cutting edge technologies. Under the hood,
            it makes significant use of <a href="https://ostree.readthedocs.org"
              >OSTree</a
            >, which can be described as “Git for large binaries”. This provides
            much of the functionality for hosting software repositories. It also
            makes Flatpak extremely efficient: applications and libraries that
            are installed with Flatpak are de-duplicated, saving disk space;
            “static deltas” reduce the size of downloads for software updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            For sandboxing, Flatpak makes use of the <a
              href="https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap">Bubblewrap</a
            > utility, as well as several Linux kernel features (such as cgroups
            and namespaces), which helps to make it portable across distributions.
          </p>

          <h2>Rapid community growth and adoption</h2>

          <p>
            It is well known that Fedora is making plans around Flatpak.
            Commenting on Flatpak, Christian F.K. Schaller (Senior Manager at
            Red Hat and member of the Fedora Workstation Working Group) stated:
            “The Fedora Workstation team are very excited about Flatpak and the
            prospects it brings for making the Linux desktop easier to develop
            for. We plan to continue supporting this effort going forward and
            help advocate it to a wider audience."
          </p>

          <p>
            There is also interest from other parties. One early adopter of
            Flatpak is <a href="https://endlessm.com/">Endless Computers</a>.
            Speaking about the launch of Flatpak, Jonathan Blandford (VP of
            Software Engineering at Endless) said: “The Flatpak launch
            represents a major milestone in providing a unified context for
            Linux developers. At Endless, we’re proud to be a part of this
            movement and have fully embraced Flatpak by readily converting all
            of our applications for our upcoming release and continuing to build
            new Flatpak apps. We encourage others to do so as well in what we
            hope to be a revolution among Linux app creation and adoption.”
          </p>

          <p>

              title="Endless Computers and its App ecosystem"
              alt="Endless Computers and its App ecosystem"
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            Other distributions are showing interest, as well as other Free
            Software companies. Simon McVittie is Senior Software Engineer at
            Collabora and a Debian developer, and is himself looking to Flatpak:
            “Bringing Flatpak technology into Debian enables us to run
            applications in a predictable environment with their most suitable
            library stack, without compromising the base OS's stability and
            flexibility. Flatpak also retains the ability to deploy security
            updates, making it a significant enhancement for the many
            Debian-based desktop and embedded distributions, both in the
            community and in commercial products.”
          </p>

          <p>
            One reason for the increasing interest in Flatpak is due to its
            adaptability and the fact that it is a genuinely upstream project.
            It can be used and adapted as part of downstream and bespoke
            solutions, is hosted on Freedesktop.org and Github, and is licensed
            with the LGPL, with no copyright assignment or contributor license
            agreement required.
          </p>

          <p>
            Larsson is obviously pleased by the momentum behind Flatpak. “It's
            exciting to see the growing interest in what we are doing, as
            developers realise the possibilities of the technology,” he said.
