          <h3 id="Why_the_name_Flatpak_">Why the name Flatpak?</h3>

          <p>
            IKEA is a world-wide known brand whose success was partly built upon
            having developed and refined the idea of flatpacking their
            furniture, which allowed them huge cost savings and efficiencies
            compared to their competitors. So when we needed a new name for the
            packaging technology that had been developed by Alex Larsson, a
            native Swede, we thought that Flatpak would both be a nice play on
            his nationality and pay homage to the success of IKEA and at the
            same time send a strong signal about how revolutionary we thought
            this new packaging technology could be for the Linux desktop.
          </p>

          <h3 id="What_is_the_origin_of_the_Flatpak_technology_">
            What is the origin of the Flatpak technology?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Flatpak is a technology that brings together many of the lessons
            learned by its creator Alexander Larsson during his long tenure as a
            Linux desktop developer and having spent time inside Red Hat working
            on container technologies. Flatpak builds upon existing technologies
            such as cgroups, namespaces, bind mounts and seccomp in the Linux
            kernel, OSTree from <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/"
              >Project Atomic</a
            >
            and the OCI format that is developed by the <a
              href="https://www.opencontainers.org/"
              >Open Container Initiative</a
            >. It has also spawned new technologies such as Bubblewrap which is
            shared between Flatpak and Project Atomic.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Is_Flatpak_tied_to_GNOME_">Is Flatpak tied to GNOME?</h3>

          <p>
            No. While Flatpak has been developed by people with a long
            involvement in the GNOME community it is not tied to any desktop. In
            fact, it was designed with the explicit goal of allowing it to build
            applications using any library stack or programming language an
            application author might want.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Is_Flatpak_tied_to_Fedora_">Is Flatpak tied to Fedora?</h3>

          <p>
            No. In fact, Flatpak and even <a href="https://flathub.org"
              >Flathub</a
            > are enabled by default on Endless OS and Linux Mint. The people developing
            Flatpak have a long history in contributing to and building Linux distributions
            like Debian, Fedora, and others, and solving the problems that arise
            when shipping applications for these platforms. Flatpak was built to
            be distribution agnostic and allow deployment on any Linux operating
            system out there.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Is_Flatpak_tied_to_Linux_">Is Flatpak tied to Linux?</h3>

          <p>
            Yes. We are explicitly using many features of the linux kernel (bind
            mounts, namespaces, seccomp, etc) to create the sandbox that Flatpak
            apps are running in. It may be possible to use equivalent
            technologies on other kernels, but that would be a non-trivial
            amount of work, and we don’t consider this one of our priorities.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Is_Flatpak_tied_to_systemd_">Is Flatpak tied to systemd?</h3>

          <p>
            No. Versions of Flatpak before 0.6.10 relied on systemd for cgroups
            setup, but this is no longer required.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Is_Flatpak_the_same_as_xdg_app_">
            Is Flatpak the same as xdg-app?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Yes, while xdg-app was a fine name to use during development we
            wanted something with wider appeal and more sparkle to it than
            xdg-app could provide. So as part of formally launching Flatpak as
            ready for use we decided to pick a more accessible and fun name.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Is_Flatpak_a_container_technology_">
            Is Flatpak a container technology?
          </h3>

          <p>
            It can be, but it doesn’t have to be. Since a desktop application
            would require quite extensive changes in order to be usable when run
            inside a container you will likely see Flatpak mostly deployed as a
            convenient library bundling technology early on, with the sandboxing
            or containerization being phased in over time for most applications.
            In general though we try to avoid using the term container when
            speaking about Flatpak as it tends to cause comparisons with Docker
            and rkt, comparisons which quickly stop making technical sense due
            to the very different problem spaces these technologies try to
            address. And thus we prefer using the term sandboxing.
          </p>

          <h3
            id="How_does_Flatpak_relate_to_freedesktop_org_technologies_such_as_desktop_files_and_AppStream_metadata_"
          >
            How does Flatpak relate to freedesktop.org technologies such as
            desktop files and AppStream metadata?
          </h3>

          <p>
            These standards are incorporated as mandatory parts in the Flatpak
            definition. By relying on these standards we are building on years
            of investment and support under Linux.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Can_Flatpak_be_used_on_servers_too_">
            Can Flatpak be used on servers too?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Flatpak is designed to run inside a desktop session and relies on
            certain session services, such as a D-Bus session bus and,
            optionally, a systemd <code>--user</code> instance. This makes Flatpak
            not a good match for a server.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the build features of Flatpak run fine outside a session,
            so you can build things on a server.
          </p>

          <h3
            id="Is_Flatpak_compatible_with_other_desktop_isolation_frameworks_"
          >
            Is Flatpak compatible with other desktop isolation frameworks?
          </h3>

          <p>
            In general unprivileged container systems can’t stack, because
            anything running inside the sandbox does not have the necessary
            privileges to set up a sandbox, nor does it have the ability to
            raise its privileges in any way. For instance, Firejail can never
            work inside Flatpak, because it is setuid. That being said, using
            multiple sandboxing frameworks at once does not really make anything
            more secure, so there is little point in trying to nest things like
            that.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is certainly possible for Flatpak and Flatpak applications to
            coexist with applications that are packaged in other ways, on the
            same host system.

            Are there any IDEs that support Flatpak?
          </h3>

          <p>Yes!</p>

          <p>
            Version 3.22.4 and newer of <a
              href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder">GNOME Builder</a
            > includes support for <code>flatpak-builder</code> manifests. This ensures
            your project is built using your selected Flatpak runtime and any external
            dependencies. Support for running your application inside Flatpak is
            also supported. By developing your application within the exact same
            environment as your users you can squash those “Works for me” bugs before
            they reach your users!
          </p>

          <h3 id="Can_I_host_my_Flatpak_app_on_GitHub_">
            Can I host my Flatpak app on GitHub?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Flatpak repositories can’t (currently) be put on GitHub in a
            convenient way. As an alternative, you can create a single-file
            bundle, and put that up on GitHub as a “release.” Note that bundles
            have some drawbacks, compared to a repository. Another option you
            have is to get your app on <a href="https://flathub.org/">Flathub</a
            >
            which will allow your users to get updates.
